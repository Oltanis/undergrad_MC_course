    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous session, you were introduced to the ideas underlying Monte Carlo simulations by modelling a simple system and extracting useful output data which (hopefully) concurred with theory.  In this session, you will be formally introduced to the general Monte Carlo program, DLMONTE, which you unknowingly used in the previous session.  This session will begin to touch upon the concepts of ensembles and how the choice of ensemble affects the outcome of a simulation and explore the possible types of moves available in each ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensembles are very important in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, where one can readily observe the macroscopic properties of a system without being able to know or control its microscopic properties.  In simple terms, an ensemble can be thought of as a collection of a large number of replicas of a system, akin to running repeating an experiment many times with the same initial conditions.  By averaging the outcomes of each of these replicas, one can create a probability distribution of possible outcomes for an experiment in a given ensemble.  In this course and statistical mechanics you will come across several different ensembles which are described in the form of three letters, describing which parameters in the ensemble of the system are kept constant.  Ensembles are defined in this manner to ensure that they demonstrate statistical equilibrium, *i.e.* ensembles do not evolve over time, these include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *N*: total number of individual objects (atoms, molecules, particles etc.) in the system kept constant.\n",
    "- *V*: system volume kept constant\n",
    "- *P*: system pressure kept constant\n",
    "- *T*: system temperature kept constant\n",
    "- *E*: the total energy of the system kept constant\n",
    "- $\\mu$: the chemical potential of the system kept constant (you'll see this later in the course)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, 'NVT' means that the total number of particles, total volume and temperature are kept constant (known as the Canonical Ensemble) and 'NPT' means that the total number of particles, total pressure and temperature are kept constant (a.k.a. the Gibbs ensemble).  Figure 1 displays physical representations of the different ensembles that are used in thermodynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Tut_3_images/Statistical_Ensembles.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center\">**Figure 1**: Visual representation of different ensembles [1]. </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may recall, a key part of Monte Carlo simulations is sampling over all possible states of the system by 'moving' through configuration space, where a move is a change from an initial configuration to a new one.  The most intuitive move is translational moves which consist of physically moving an object from one set of coordinates to another (within reason).  But other types of moves are possible, depending on the type of ensemble used.  For instance, one can define a volume move, where the proposed move is changing the total system volume by altering one or more length scales of the system and (as we will see later in the course) one can also perform insert/delete and swap moves of objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence of moves defines the 'trajectory' of the system in configurational space.  It is important to understand that this is not the same as the physical motion of individual objects in the system, or the system itself, which is the traditional definition of a trajectory. There is no 'time' in Monte Carlo simulations; nothing *in* the system evolves with time.  This limits Monte Carlo to simulation of static systems only, so it cannot determine any dynamic properties of the system, like diffusion coefficients or rates of reaction.  Any reference to time in this context refers to the computational time required to complete the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: NVT Lennard-Jones Material\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, you will be given an overview of the program that you will use (or have used) for all Monte Carlo calculations throughout this course: DLMONTE.  DLMONTE is the name of a program which provides a general Monte Carlo framework for use in scientific research.  This program is a direct Monte Carlo analogue to the Molecular Dynamics program DLPOLY (which you used in Tutorial 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to learn how to use DLMONTE is by applying it to a simple system, in this case determining the thermal behaviour of a Lennard-Jones solid.  This part of the tutorial is directly analagous to Tutorial 1, except now we shall be using Monte Carlo to simulate our Lennard-Jones material instead of Molecular Dynamics.  This will hopefully help highlight the differences in their respective approaches to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this part of the tutorial is to introduce some of the basic commands and file formats that are used by DLMONTE. DLMONTE requires at least 3 input files: FIELD, CONFIG and CONTROL files and we will discuss each of these in turn.\n",
    "\n",

    "So far in this course, we have assumed that the system has reached equilibrium with its surroundings, *i.e.* that the system has reached its most thermodynamically stable state with minimal net exchange of energy with its surroundings.  Equilibration is incredibly important to Monte Carlo (and many other computational modelling techniques) as it ensures reproducibility of results.  If we start from an arbitrary initial state with a given set of parameters, the first stage of the calculation will be establishing equilibrium, with the output during this period being of little use and should be omitted from any statistical analysis of the output.  In DLMONTE (and DLPOLY) we account for this period of time using the 'equilibration' parameter in the CONTROL file.  This states the point at which output data is included in any statistical analysis.  This 'equilibration time' will be different for every system with a given set of initial parameters and is usually estimated during preliminary analysis of the data.\n",

    "## Conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "After this session, you should now be familiar with the input/output files of DLMONTE as well as running calculation with the program. You have demonstrated its use by running simulations on the simple Lennard-Jones solid system and confirmed that it shows thermodynamic behaviour consistent with real materials. You have been introduced to the concept of ensembles in thermodynamics, in particular the NVT and NPT ensembles. You should also have an appreciation for the possible types of Monte Carlo moves that can be proposed within NVT and NPT ensembles and the differences between them. In the next session, we will move onto simulations under the $\\mu$VT (Grand Canonical) ensemble and troduce the concept of detailed balance in the Monte Carlo technique.\n",

    "### 2. Detailed balance for volume moves\n",
    "\n",
    "Establishing the condition for detailed balance in a simulation where volume moves are enabled is more complicated than for translational moves alone.  To maintain detailed balance with volume moves, the acceptance probability for a move from an initial configuration of particles in positions $\\mathbf{r}_1$ in a volume, $V_1$ to a new configuration, $\\mathbf{r}_2$ with a volume $V_2$, changes in the Metropolis algorithm to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{\\mathrm{acc}}([\\mathbf{r}_{1},V_1] \\rightarrow [\\mathbf{r}_2,V_2]) = \\min(1, \\exp \\{- \\beta [U(\\mathbf{r}_2) - U(\\mathbf{r}_1) + P_{ext}(V_{2}-V_{1}) - N \\beta^{-1} \\ln(V_{2} / V_{1}) ] \\} )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P_{ext}$ is the external pressure acting on the system and $\\beta = \\frac{1}{kT}$.  In most simulations, the positions of every object in a system is expressed as dimensionless, scalable position coordinates, which scale with the size of the system such that when the volume changes, the *relative* positions of the objects in the new size remains the same, but the distance between objects in the system goes up or down depending on whether the volume has increased or decreased.  However, the number of possible configurations of a system is determined in part by its total volume, such that a larger system will have more possible configurations.  This must be accounted with the $N \\beta^{-1} \\ln(V_{2} / V_{1})$ term.  The other terms in the exponent come from the probability distributions of isothermal-isobaric systems, where the $P_{ext}(V_{2}-V_{1})$ represents the work done *on* the system by an external pressure.  For more information on detailed balance for volume moves, see [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing volume moves on molecular systems, the position of the centre of mass of the molecule is scaled, as opposed to the positions of all of its constituent atoms, rationalise this caveat. (Hint: what would happen to all the chemical bonds if the atom positions were scaled instead? How would this affect the likelihood of accepting the move?) "
