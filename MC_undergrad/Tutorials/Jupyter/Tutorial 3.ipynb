    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous session, you were introduced to the ideas underlying the Monte Carlo simulation technique by modelling a simple system and extracting useful output data which (hopefully) concurred with theory. In this session, you will be formally introduced to the general Monte Carlo program, DLMONTE, which you unknowingly used in the previous session. This session will begin to touch upon the concepts of ensembles and how the choice of ensemble affects the outcome of a simulation and explore the possible types of moves available in each ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensembles are very important in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, where one can readily observe the macroscopic properties of a system without being able to know or control its microscopic properties. In simple terms, an ensemble can be thought of as a collection of a large number of replicas of a system, akin to running repeating an experiment many times with the same initial conditions. By averaging the outcomes of each of these replicas, one can create a probability distribution of possible outcomes for an experiment in a given ensemble. In this course and statistical mechanics you will come across several different ensembles which are described in the form of three letters, describing which parameters of the system are kept constant for the ensemble. Ensembles are defined in this manner to ensure that statistical equilibrium is maintained, *i.e.* ensembles not to evolve over time, these include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *N*: total number of individual objects (atoms, molecules, particles etc.) in the system kept constant.\n",
    "- *V*: system volume kept constant\n",
    "- *P*: system pressure kept constant\n",
    "- *T*: system temperature kept constant\n",
    "- *E*: the total energy of the system kept constant\n",
    "- *μ*: the chemical potential of the system kept constant (you’ll see this later in the course)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, ‘NVT’ means that the total number of particles, total volume and temperature are kept constant (known as the Canonical Ensemble) and ‘NPT’ means that the total number of particles, total pressure and temperature are kept constant (a.k.a. the Gibbs ensemble). Figure 1 displays physical representations of the different ensembles that are used in thermodynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Tut_3_images/Statistical_Ensembles.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1**: Visual representation of different ensembles [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may recall, a key part of Monte Carlo simulations is the sampling over all possible states of the system by ‘moving’ through configuration space, where a move is a change from an initial configuration to a new one. So far in this course we have looked at moves which consist of physically moving an object from one set of coordinates to another (within reason), which are known as translational moves. But this is not the only move that can be made in Monte Carlo simulations, Other moves are possible, depending on the type of ensemble used. For instance, one can define a volume move, where the proposed move is changing the total system volume by altering one or more length scales of the system and as we will see later in the course one can also perform insert/delete and swap moves of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence of moves defines the ‘trajectory’ of the system in configurational space. It is important to understand that this is not the same as the physical motion of individual objects in the system, or the system itself, which is the traditional definition of a trajectory that you are probably used to. There is no ‘time’ in Monte Carlo simulations; nothing *in* the system evolves with time. This limits Monte Carlo to simulation of static systems only, so it cannot determine any dynamic properties of the system, like diffusion coefficients or rates of reaction.. Any reference to time in this context refers to the computational time required to complete the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: NVT Lennard-Jones Material\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, you will be given an overview of the program that you will use (or have used) throughout this course: DLMONTE. DLMONTE is the name of a program which provides a general Monte Carlo framework for use in scientific research. This program is a direct Monte Carlo analogue to the Molecular Dynamics program DL_POLY (which you used in Tutorial 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to learn how to use DLMONTE is by applying it to a simple system, in this case determining the thermal behaviour of a Lennard-Jones solid. This part of the tutorial is directly analagous to Tutorial 1, except now we shall be using Monte Carlo to simulate our Lennard-Jones material instead of Molecular Dynamics. This will hopefully help highlight the differences in their respective approaches to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this part of the tutorial is to introduce some of the basic commands and file formats that are used by DLMONTE. DLMONTE requires at least 3 input files: FIELD, CONFIG and CONTROL files and we will discuss each of these in turn.\n",
    "\n",

    "So far in this course, we have assumed that the system has reached equilibrium with its surroundings, i.e. that the system has reached its most thermodynamically stable state with minimal net exchange of energy with its surroundings. Equilibration is incredibly important to Monte Carlo (and many other computational modelling techniques) as it ensures reproducibility of results. If we start from an arbitrary initial state with a given set of parameters, the first stage of the calculation will be establishing equilibrium, with the output during this period being of little use and should be omitted from any statistical analysis of the output. In DLMONTE (and DLPOLY) we account for this period o time using the ‘equilibration’ parameter in the CONTROL file. This states the point at which output data is included in any statistical analysis. This ‘equilibration time’ will be different for every system with a given set of initial parameters and is usually estimated during preliminary analysis of the data.\n",

You have demonstrated its use by running simulations on the simple Lennard-Jones solid system and confirmed that it shows thermodynamic behaviour consistent with real materials. You have been introduced to the concept of ensembles in thermodynamics, in particular the NVT and NPT ensembles. You should also have an appreciation for the possible types of Monte Carlo moves that can be proposed within NVT and NPT ensembles and the differences between them. In the next session, we will move onto simulations under the $\\mu$VT (Grand Canonical) ensemble and troduce the concept of detailed balance in the Monte Carlo technique.\n",
