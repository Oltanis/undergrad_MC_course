How-to
------

To build these tutorials you will need to have [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) installed on your machin (and latex if you wish to build the pdf version).
To build the worksheets in html format use:

make html

or for latex:

make latexpdf

This will create build directories containing the compiled documents.
