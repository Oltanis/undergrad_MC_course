    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this course, we have been running simulations on systems with a constant number of particles (NVT or NPT ensembles).  This is useful for studying systems where there is no exchange of particles from one defined type to another and where predicting system behaviour by optimising particle number, *N*, is not required.  However, not all systems can be modelled in this way, for instance, phase coexistence, where more than one phase of a material exist in equilibrium, is very difficult to model accurately if the total number of particles in each phase is kept constant.  Other examples include: adsorption onto a surface (as you will see in this and future sessions), effect of solid-state defects on bulk properties and dissolution rates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we know that ensembles require three parameters to be kept constant, so what replaces *N*? The answer is chemical potential, $\\mu$. There are several definitions of chemical potential in the literature, but the most common definition is the effect of number of particles on the total Gibbs Free Energy, *G*, of the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu = \\Bigl|\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial N}\\Bigr|_{V, T}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Or in a multi-component system, the effect of system composition on *G*, where the i:sup:`th` component of the system has its own chemical potential, $\\mu_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu_i = \\Bigl|\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial N_i}\\Bigr|_{V, T, N_{j, j \\neq i}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mu$ can be thought of as the 'chemical driving force' for a system to reach equilibrium (see Figure 1) where the equilibrium composition of a system is the composition with minimum Gibbs free energy.  For alternative explanations of the chemical potential, try [1](http://www.icsm.fr/Local/icsm/files/286/JFD_Chemical-potential.pdf), [2](http://chem.atmos.colostate.edu/AT620/Sonia_uploads/ATS620_F11_Lecture5/Lecture5_AT620_083111.pdf) or any physical chemistry textbook.\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: center\">**Figure 1**: A graphical representation of the chemical potential of a two-component (A and B particles) system driving it towards its equilibrium composition. </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\mu$ VT ensemble is known as the Grand Canonical ensemble and is the most widely-used 'variable *N*' ensemble.  Other simulation techniques, like Molecular Dynamics, are very inefficient at accurately modelling systems where the total number of particles isn't constant, which is why Monte Carlo is the preferred technique in these situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One could, in principle, also choose to use an $\\mu$ PT ensemble, what kind of problems could arise when running simulations under this ensemble?"

    "## Conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, you have been introduced to the Grand Canonical (GC) ensemble, where the total number of particles in the system can vary but the chemical potential of the system remains constnt.  This is useful for systems with interfaces or exchange of one particle type for another and has no equivalent in deterministic simulation techniques like Molecular Dynamics.  You have applied the GC emsemble to the hypothetical problem of Lennard-Jones particles adsorbing onto a surface to determine the ideal conditions for adsorption/desorption.  In the next session, we will apply the GC ensemble to the physical system of methane adsorption onto the surface of a zeolite in order to predict the conditions for ideal adsorption.\n",

    "In this session, we have defined our Lennard-Jones particles as 'molecules' made up of one atom.  For larger molecules, there are additional terms which come from the specific orientation of molecules.  Molecular rotations are difficult to model accurately in this way because the molecule can change its orientation between insertion and deletion moves, leading to technically 'different' molecules being inserted and deleted, breaking detailed balance.  Does this apply to both linear and nonlinear molecules? What angles can you rotate (symmetric) linear molecules that will satisfy detailed balance? What are the possible solutions to this problem? "
